# Joint Inversion of Receiver Functions and Surface Waves Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo

This code performs a joint inversion of receiver functions and surface wave data using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion. This is a Trans-dimensional, Hierarchical, Bayesian Inversion (THBI). 

If you use this code, please cite Brunsvik et al. (2024) and Eilon et al. (2018). See also Golos et al. (2024) and Petruska and Eilon (2022).

## Running the examples

1. Run the example synthetic joint inversion by executing `example_github/RUN_example.m`.
2. Once the synthetic inversion is running, you can modify the eastern US example, applied to real data, found in the `ENAM` folder.

## Dependencies

#### Required depending on your data types

- **Surface wave phase velocity**: Mineos (**contact author for access**). Working on integration with Josh Russell's public version, but it's not ready yet: [Mineos_synthetics](https://github.com/jbrussell/MINEOS_synthetics).
- **Surface wave ellipticity**: HV code from Tanimoto and Tsuboi (2009, GRL). Public release pending.
- **Receiver functions**: [PropMat](https://github.com/brennanbrunsvik/PropMat). Alternatively, [Telewavesim](https://github.com/paudetseis/Telewavesim) is **partially** supported.
- **$H-\kappa$ stacks**, including radial anisotropy: [hk_anis](https://github.com/brennanbrunsvik/hk_anis).

#### Other dependencies

These were placed in the `~/MATLAB/` folder. Refer to `a0_STARTUP_BAYES.m` for setup details.

## Setup steps

1. Update paths in `a0_STARTUP_BAYES.m` and obtain necessary dependencies.
1. Compile codes. 
    1. All Fortran forward modelling codes. 
    1. mex code in the `fastBSpline` folder to speed up spline calculations (optional).
1. Run the synthetic test in the `example_github` folder.
1. For real data applications, use the `ENAM` folder as a starting point. Modify "matguts" and `evdata1_database.m` to load your data from your computer. 
1. HPC
    1. Use the "transfer" folder to migrate code from your work machine to your HPC. 
    1. Modify `ENAM/batch` code (Slurm scripts for UCSB clusters) for your HPC setup.
    1. Use `retrieve_results_example` to get results from the HPC and format them (expect ~100 Mb/station).
1. The `3d_models` folder creates a 3D model from the many 1D station PDFs.

## Expected behaviors

- IO optimization: For systems with many cores, Fortran IO operations need a folder in RAM ("ramDriveTHBI") for efficiency. This should mount automatically.  
- Parameter updates: `update_bayes_inv_parms.m` will modify your inversion parameters depending on your STAMP. 
- `run_one_chain.m` is complex and hard to change because it handles many cases where Mineos fails. Test thoroughly if modified.

For any further assistance or to obtain dependencies, feel free to contact the author.
